🐍 Age & Palindrome Checker - Python Project
This simple Python project demonstrates two interactive programs:

Age Calculator – Validates user input and calculates a user's age.

Palindrome Checker – Checks if a word or phrase is a palindrome.

📂 Project Structure
The notebook contains two main Python code cells:

1. 👤 Age Calculator
Input:

User's name.

Year of birth.

Validation:

Ensures year of birth is not negative or greater than the current year (2025).

Output:

Displays the calculated age with the user's name.

Sample Interaction:
bash
Copy
Edit
Enter your name: Hodal
Enter your year of birth: -2
The year of birth can't be negative!!
Enter your year of birth: 2010
gisele, your age is: 15
2. 🔁 Palindrome Checker
Input:

Word or phrase.

Validation:

Handles empty input.

Ignores case and non-alphanumeric characters.

Output:

Indicates if the input is a palindrome.

Sample Interaction:
bash
Copy
Edit
Enter a word or phrase: ifi
Yes, it's a palindrome!
